          I am Nguyen Tien Hung, a passionate software developer, especially <b>.NET</b>, as well as
          game developer. Having found a passion for technology and games when I was younger, I was
          drawn into the beauty of problem-solving with algorithm, a foundation for each software
          architecture, and immersing myself through the art of game development. As technologies
          evolves, I strive myself to learn new things everyday throughout projects and future
          inventions.
